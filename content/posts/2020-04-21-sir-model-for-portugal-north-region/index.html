<p>This post is just a placeholder to another post I’m maintaining in Rpubs since April, 11.</p>
<p>There I’m comparing the SIR Model (derived from <a href="https://timchurches.github.io/blog">Tim Churches</a>) that I ran on April, 11, at least for now, with the real data available for the North region of Portugal during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Please follow <a href="https://rpubs.com/franzbischoff/597559">this link</a> for the SIR Model at RPubs.</p>
