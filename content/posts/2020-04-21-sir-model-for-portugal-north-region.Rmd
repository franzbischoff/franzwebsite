This post is just a placeholder to another post I'm maintaining in Rpubs since April, 11.

There I'm comparing the SIR Model (derived from [Tim Churches](https://timchurches.github.io/blog)) that I ran on April, 11, at least for now, with the real data available for the North region of Portugal during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Please follow [this link](https://rpubs.com/franzbischoff/597559) for the SIR Model at RPubs.
